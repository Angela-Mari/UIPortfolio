# UI Portfolio

Yeah I could have used one of those portfolio sites to show off what I've learned in terms of UX design but wouldn't it be so much more fun to build it from scratch? Follow along as I build out my portfolio. More content to come!

## Dev Tools
This app is a front-end single page web app built with [React and Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). Feel free to clone this repo and learn how to build your own portfolio! I've tried to keep it optimized for mobile and desktop screensizes.

### Design Process
Check out the mockup for this site made using Adobe XD [here]()

## Deployment
This app is deployed on my site at [angelageorge.com/ui-portfolio](https://angelageorge.com/ui-portfolio). Special thanks to Kendall George for writing a custom htaccess file to help Wordpress and React Router get along.

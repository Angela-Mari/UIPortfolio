# UI Portfolio

Yeah I could have used one of those portfolio sites to show off what I've learned in terms of UI design but wouldn't it be so much more fun to build it from scratch? Follow along as I build out my portfolio. More content to come!

## Dev Tools
This app is a front-end single page web app built with [React](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). Feel free to clone this repo and learn how to build your own portfolio! I've tried to keep it optimized for mobile and desktop screensizes. 

## Deployment
This app is deployed on my site at www.angelageorge.com/ui-portfolio. Special thanks to Kendall George for writing a custom htaccess file to help Wordpress and React Router get along.
